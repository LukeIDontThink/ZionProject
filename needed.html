	<h1>Accommodations</h1>
	<p>If you're in space its obvious you need things to survive, like a space suit, food, water, and plants (for oxygen).</p>
	<h1>Food and Work</h1>
	<p>We brought plenty of helthy food such as salid and apples and all that good stuff, we even gave them plants sothey could grow their own food. Work will be simple, the chairs have seat belts so the astronots can work andtheir laptops are custom for the spaceship so we can keep them in place while they work on stuff</p>
	<h1>Liveing longer on a spaceship</h1>
	<p>To live longer you need all the things earth has but just in a smaller supply: water, food, house(spaceship),something to do(work), and all the other things that come with living regularly</p>
